        <img src="images/hublot-mayweather.jpg" height="750px">
        <p> Floyd Mayweather was a professional boxer, and is considered by many, the best pound for pound boxer of all time. His professional career spanned from 1996 to 2015 with one fight comeback in 2017. 
            During his career, Floyd Mayweather was undefeated with 50 wins, 27 of which came by way of knockout. Mayweather fought in 5 different weight classes and won 15 major world titles, a feat that only a few boxers have achieved.  
            Mayweather was also one of the most lucrative pay-per-view attractions of all time.  One of his iconic matches came in 2015 against boxing legend, Manny Pacquiao.  The fight had been anticipated for a long time, but the deal would always fall through.  
            However, 2015 saw the two sides reach an agreement to fight.  The match was prompted as the Fight of the Century, with Mayweather leaving victorious.
